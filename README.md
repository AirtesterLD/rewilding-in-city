# **Rewilding in city**



## **Overview**



Rewilding is a process allows natural processes to repair damaged ecosystems and restore degraded landscapes. **"Rewilding in City"** is a balance tool for urban mediations between urban development and environmental restoration and multi-agencies under complicated urban background.  



## **Guideline**

Before we use the tool, we need a guideline about the Lea Valley, the location. There are three maps as a guideline for users. The base map shows the basic information about green space traffic etc. And the suitability map with the potential corridor which can help people find some bottlenecks. And final one, the social map, which can highlight the area with higher social value.

## **Manual**

This is the manual about the balance tool. The book tells how to use the tool and explains the logic behind the tool construction, step by step. Some basic function and this is the logic explanation. Some thing about how can I get the suitability map, the potential corridor, and environmental value, the social value, and how can I calculate the price and the algorithm about how can I simulate the natural expansion. It is not perfect one, but if some weights updating and more accurate data or logic, it has potential to be improved.

## Conclusion

![Result](https://github.com/AirtesterLD/rewilding-in-city/blob/master/img/Result.jpg)Actually, the tool cannot provide a perfect scenario that meet every agency demand and we only can get the most acceptable plan in different positions, conditions, or different groups.
